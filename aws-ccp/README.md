## Six advantages of Cloud Computing
 1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
 2. Benefit from massive economies at scale 
 3. Stop guessing capacity
 4. Increase speed and agility
 5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
 6. Go global in minutes

## Types of Cloud Computing
 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    - Provide building blocks for IT
    - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
    - Highest level of flexibility
    - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
    - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

### Notes

 - [x] On SaaS you don't manage anything
 - [x] On PaaS you only manage Applications and Data
 - [x] On IaaS you manage Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware and OS
 - [x] On-premise you manage everything
