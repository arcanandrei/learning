TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Provide building blocks for IT
  - Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - Highest level of flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

Notes:
 - On SaaS you don't manage anything
 - On PaaS you only manage Applications and Data
 - On IaaS you manage Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware and OS
 - On-premise you manage everything
